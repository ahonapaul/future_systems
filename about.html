        my sister and i used to share a room, a bed, a desk until we couldn't physically fit into the same room anymore.
        we used to say that it was the getting bigger and older that moved me out, but what if it was the ghost hiding in our sconces?
        what if the reason I left was to escape the surveillance? it wasn't just our parents, but everything in our room was constantly 
        watching us. 
        </span>
        <span>
        this is a reimagining of our childhood, where the monsters under our bed are actually government spies, and the desk 
        lamp has an eyeball to watch us at all times.
